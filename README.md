## Project Description

I utilized the Natural Language Toolkit to analyze a body of language word by word. I created a Markov chain model to predict the probability of future, random sentences. Based upon any given word from an analyzed text, my program predicts the likelihood of the next word to follow that word. From here, entire random sentences are generated. I utilized Charlotte Bronte's *Jane Eyre* to test my program.
